---

The Radlet ecosystem was created keeping *speed* and *flexibility* in mind and thus making edge computing a little more easier for people who wish to tinker. The existing IOT solutions are either proprietary or are too tightly coupled for a regular user to tinker with. We bring the speed of coupled system and the flexibility of a decoupled system with the perfectly balanced IOT ecosystem - Radlet. The ecosystem consists of **three primary components** out of which this repository hold the code for **Radlet-Composer**.

## :four_leaf_clover: 1. Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This project uses flutter for cross platform application development. The recommended IDE for development is VS Code which gels nicely with the Flutter SDK. To setup Flutter SDK on your machine, follow the Flutter [docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux) accordingly. If **flutter doctor** returns a non zero code then we are good to go.

### 1.a Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Android SDK
- Android Studio

### 1.b Build

The build build step is as simple as pressing **F5** while on VS Code. A physical device is recommended for testing the app.
